# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 2026-01-02

This Privacy Policy explains how eisonAI ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use the eisonAI app and Safari extension (the "Service").

## 1. Information We Collect
### 1.1 Information You Provide
- Content you choose to input, import, or create in the Service (e.g., notes, highlights, tags).
- Settings and preferences you configure.

### 1.2 Information Collected Automatically
- Device and app information (e.g., device model, OS version, app version) for reliability and troubleshooting.
- Diagnostic data and crash logs, if you have enabled sharing with developers.

### 1.3 Purchases
- App Store purchase metadata (e.g., product identifiers, transaction status). We do not receive your payment card information.

## 2. How We Use Information
We use information to:
- Provide and operate the Service.
- Improve performance, reliability, and user experience.
- Provide customer support and respond to requests.
- Comply with legal obligations.

## 3. On-Device Processing and Optional Sync
By default, content is processed locally on your device. If you enable optional sync features (such as iCloud/CloudKit sync), your data may be stored in your private iCloud database associated with your Apple ID. Apple’s policies govern their handling of that data.

## 4. Sharing of Information
We do not sell your personal information. We may share information:
- With service providers that help us operate the Service (e.g., Apple services for in-app purchases and iCloud).
- If required by law or to protect our rights and users.
- In connection with a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, subject to this Policy.

## 5. Data Retention
We retain information only as long as needed to provide the Service or as required by law. You can delete local data within the app or by uninstalling the app. If sync is enabled, you can manage data through the app or iCloud settings.

## 6. Security
We use reasonable safeguards to protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## 7. Children’s Privacy
The Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 8. Your Choices and Rights
Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your information. Contact us to exercise these rights.

## 9. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Policy from time to time. We will post the updated Policy with a new effective date.
