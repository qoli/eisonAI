# Product Hunt Launch Material

## 🏷️ Tagline
The Cognitive Index™ for your brain. Turn web articles into structured knowledge with Local AI.

## 📝 Description (Short)
eisonAI transforms linear reading into a structured experience. Using on-device AI (WebLLM), it extracts summaries, key points, and logical skeletons from web pages, allowing you to navigate content non-linearly. Private, offline, and open-source.

## 📄 Main Post (Maker's Comment)

**Hello Product Hunt! 👋**

I’m Ronnie, the creator of eisonAI.

We live in an age of information overload. We bookmark articles to "read later," but "later" often becomes "never" because the friction of engaging with long-form content is just too high. We fear getting lost in a wall of text.

I built **eisonAI** to solve this by changing *how* we read.

### 🧠 The Core Concept: Cognitive Indexing™
Most tools just save the *content*. eisonAI extracts the **structure**.
Before you dive into a 5,000-word article, eisonAI uses local LLMs to generate a map of the content:
*   **Summaries**: Get the gist instantly.
*   **Key Points**: See the main arguments at a glance.
*   **Logical Skeleton**: Jump to the sections that matter most to you.

This enables **Non-linear Reading**. You don't have to follow the author's linear path. You can explore the ideas based on your own curiosity and questions.

### 🔒 Why Local AI?
Privacy isn't a feature; it's a requirement for a "second brain."
eisonAI runs 100% on your device (iPhone, iPad, Mac) using **WebGPU** and **MLCSwift**.
*   No data sent to the cloud.
*   Works offline.
*   Zero subscription fees for API usage.

### 📱 Tech Stack (For the Geeks)
*   **Native App**: 100% SwiftUI.
*   **Safari Extension**: Vanilla JS + WebAssembly.
*   **Inference**: WebLLM (Qwen2/Llama3 quantized) running in the browser + MLCSwift for the native app.
*   **Sync**: CloudKit for seamless Apple ecosystem integration.

I’d love to hear your feedback! What’s the biggest friction point in your reading workflow?

Happy reading! 🚀
